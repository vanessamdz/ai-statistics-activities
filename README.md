# AI Statistics Activities
This repository contains all the activities completed during the statistics module of the Advanced Artificial Intelligence in Data Science I class. All activities were implemented using Jupyter Notebook with Python.

## Activities
1. Linear Regression 1
2. Linear Regression 2
3. Classification Algorithms
4. Parameter Estimation
5. t-Student Distribution

## Corrections Made
The following corrections were made based on previous feedback from the teacher:
### Activity: Parameter Estimation
- The probability calculation has been adjusted as follows: p = n / n.sum() to obtain a result of 0.2977.

### Activity: t-Student Distribution
- Corrections were made in the conclusions of the results. If p-value <= 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.
- The QQ-plot graphs were adjusted to a "45-degree" line instead of an "s" line.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized for these activities:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- SciPy
- math
